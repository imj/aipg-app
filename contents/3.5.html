// Tournament Error — Deck Problem


		<div style="">
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>The contents of a deck or sideboard do not match the decklist registered and the decklist represents what the player intended to play.</p>
</div>

<p style="margin-top: -5px"></p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> If the deck and decklist are not the same, the player could potentially modify his or her deck on the fly. This can normally be caught through the process of deck checks, and decklists are there so that players can have a written record of what they intend to play. If it is inaccurate, there is little point in the decklist existing at all. A common way this error can occur is when a player fails to desideboard after a match, then presents a deck in a sideboarded configuration for game 1 of their next match. Also possible here is the case of a player scooping up cards at the end of a game and now having one or more of an opponents cards in their deck when presenting (or, alternatively, missing one or more cards from their deck).<br>
</div><p></p>
<p>If there are extra cards stored with the sideboard that could conceivably be played in the player’s deck, they will be considered a part of the sideboard unless they are:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: -10px">
<li>Promotional cards that have been handed out as part of the tournament.</li>
<li>Double-faced cards represented by checklist cards in the deck.</li>
<li>Double-faced cards being used to represent the back side of cards in the deck. These cards must not be sleeved in the same way as cards in the main deck and/or sideboard.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> It is important that the sideboard is kept physically far enough away that it doesn’t become mixed with the player’s library. Cards in a deckbox that could conceivably be used in the deck can be suspicious, and provide an opportunity for the player to cheat by being added to the deck in between games. We want to remove this opportunity and so cards in the deckbox are considered to be part of the sideboard unless explicitly excepted. It can be a good idea for a supplementary announcement involving cards in deckboxes to be issued so that we can curb this behavior.<p></p>
<p>Players that present their sideboard by removing it from their deck box and identifying it to the opponent at the start of the match should not receive this penalty, even if there are other cards remaining in the deck box that don’t fit one of the above exceptions. Players should be encouraged to get into this habit.</p>
<p>Promotional cards that were given out at the tournament have an exception because otherwise, we would be giving players a Game Loss during every deck check at a Grand Prix.  Double Faced cards have an exception because…where else are you supposed to keep them if you are using checklist cards? Those DFCs need to be in different sleeves to lower the risk that they be accidentally or intentionally shuffled into the deck itself, causing more than 4 of the card to be present.</p></div>
<p>Cards in different sleeves, tokens, and double-faced cards for which checklists are being used are ignored when determining deck (not sideboard) legality.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> If your card is in my deck, and it’s obvious from the back of the sleeve that it doesn’t belong in the deck, then I don’t get a penalty. Also, tokens aren’t cards, so they don’t count anyway. Don’t forget to make sure they still have a 60 card deck after you remove the offenders; that part is still illegal.  Additionally meld cards count as double-faced cards here.</div>
<p>If a player is unable to locate cards (or identical equivalents) from their main deck, treat it as a Decklist Problem instead. If sideboard cards are missing, make a note of this, but issue no penalty.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> If a player has lost one or more cards in their deck, and has no quick way to replace them (if it’s a mythic that the venue is sold out of, for instance, or they don’t wish to buy replacements), then the infraction is <a href="https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/ipg3-4/">Decklist Problem</a>, rather than Deck Problem since they can no longer play a deck that matches the list as intended. In fact, this particular case is example D. in Decklist problem – “A player loses some cards and is unable to find replacement copies, making her unable to play a deck that matches her decklist.”<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If sideboard cards are wrong or inaccurate, a penalty may be merited due to the potential for advantage. Conversely, losing sideboard cards cannot provide an advantage – in fact, it is a disadvantage – so we do not need to add insult to injury by applying a penalty as well. Players can’t spend unreasonable amounts of time searching for replacement sideboard cards, but “found” sideboard cards after this measure has been implemented may be added back into the deck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note that often times in limited events, players trade, throw away, or file in with the rest of their collections all cards from their pool that are not in their main deck. This behavior should not be penalized but rather handled by the above instructions.</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">Examples</h2>
<ul class="list-group" style="text-align: justify;margin-left: 0px">
<li class="list-group-item"><strong>A.</strong> A player has 59 cards in their deck, but 60 listed on their decklist.</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><strong>B.</strong> A player has a <a href="https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/wp-content/plugins/lems-mtg-helper/lems-mtg-helper-cardfinder.php?find=Pacifism&width=223&height=310" class="jTip" name="">Pacifism</a> in their deck from a previous opponent.</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><strong>C.</strong> In game one of a match, A player has <a href="https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/wp-content/plugins/lems-mtg-helper/lems-mtg-helper-cardfinder.php?find=Pithing+Needle&width=223&height=310" class="jTip" name="">Pithing Needle</a> in their deck, but only has one registered in their sideboard.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> For the first example, we have a deck that is not legal, though the decklist itself IS legal. Therefore, the error is with the deck, not the decklist, and we deal with it here. Example B is a case where the card just got scooped up during the previous round, but still has resulted in the deck being different than that which is intended. Example C is a failure to de-sideboard error, which results in the deck not matching that configuration which is intended for game 1.</div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;margin-top: 20px">Philosophy</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0px">Players are expected to call attention to deck errors immediately, and not gain any potential advantage from having the cards in their deck.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> If a player does not call attention to a deck error they notice right away, they may reasonably be considered to be trying to gain an advantage from it. A player that waits to call a judge until the point that the error would become public (from a “reveal your hand” type of effect or something similar) has not called attention to it when they first noticed the issue.</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0px">The most common forms of deck error are failure to desideboard and having a card in the wrong deck. Both of these are difficult to gain advantage from without obvious cheating. Denying them the card that they would have otherwise be working with is sufficient to compensate for the easily discovered situations.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> Since these two errors are both common (ish) and, as stated, difficult to take advantage of without being very obviously cheating, the penalty of a warning should be enough to educate the players to not repeat the infraction. Alongside the fix of removing the errant cards, this should combine to be enough of a deterrent.</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0px">Duplicates of cards that begin in the main deck are more problematic, as they are not as easy to realize and catch, and thus mandate an upgraded penalty.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> It’s much simpler to abuse a case where the library has additional copies of a card from the sideboard in game 1 of a match. It’s also much harder to catch, and, as a result, needs to have a harsher penalty associated with it to dissuade the potential for abuse.</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0px">A window in which the error is a Game Loss is necessary to discourage intentional abuse. Once that point has passed, the opponent agrees that the deck is valid. Judges should always be mindful of the abuse possibilities when investigating these infractions.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> This section refers to the window in the first upgrade path discussed below. The window for the upgrade needs to exist as a harsher discouragement against cheating. If the error is discovered by your opponent, during the presentation of your deck, you’re still getting that Game Loss penalty.</div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">Additional Remedy</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0px">Remove any incorrect cards from the deck, including any sideboard cards that could not yet legally have been added. Locate any cards missing from the deck and shuffle them into the randomized portion of the deck.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> Once the deck has been determined to be in an incorrect configuration, we want to return it to the intended configuration as simply as possible. Removing any sideboard cards that shouldn’t be there is the easiest way to fix the failure to desideboard issue. Additionally, if missing cards are noticed, we simply add them back into the deck and shuffle it to return it to the intended configuration.<span style="font-weight: 400"> Be sure to keep any parts of the library that are in a known order stay that way.</span></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0px">If the missing card(s) are with the sideboard and it isn’t the first game, choose the ones to be shuffled into the deck at random from main deck cards in the sideboard.<b> </b></p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> This case can occur when a player is looking through their deckbox (say to grab a token or something) and notices a card present with the sideboard that should be in the deck. If the deck is determined to be incorrect (specifically if there is 59 or fewer cards, or the deck is otherwise somehow illegal, not that a player intended to sideboard a card in and missed their opportunity to do so), we can restore the deck to a legal configuration by randomly adding a card back in from the sideboard. Note- this fix should only return main deck cards into the deck.</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0px">If the error is discovered during opening hands, instruct the player to mulligan. Otherwise, do not replace discovered erroneous cards in hands or other sets (such as a group of cards being scried or drawn). If the missing card(s) were in a previous or current opponent’s deck, issue penalties to both players.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> In the opening hand scenario, we apply the additional remedy of fixing the deck first, then instruct them to mulligan after this. Make sure you know how many cards they have in hand before you begin the fix, (though both players should generally be aware of this) so you can ensure they mulligan to the correct number after the deck has been restored.<p></p>
<p>If the error is discovered at a time not during the opening hand, the card is simply removed and not replaced. This is again as mitigation of potential advantage.</p>
<p>If the missing or extra card was from another player’s deck, both of the players have decks that don’t match what they intended to play, and so both of them get a warning.</p></div>
<h5 style="width: 140px;text-align: center"><div class="card"><div class="card-header">Upgrade</div></div></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0px">If the deck or sideboard is discovered to be incorrect while presented to the opponent for pre-game shuffling, and the missing cards are not in the opponent’s deck, the penalty is a Game Loss.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> This upgrade path exists to discourage cheating. The process of presenting your deck and sideboard to an opponent is a statement that “this deck is legal and ready for you to shuffle.” If the opponent discovers the deck to be illegal during shuffling or counting, the penalty is upgraded to a Game Loss.</div>
<h5 style="width: 140px;text-align: center"><div class="card"><div class="card-header">Upgrade</div></div></h5>
<p>If an incorrect card in the deck or hand becomes visible to an opponent (for example due to it being revealed or put into a graveyard) or is discovered by a judge during a deck check, the penalty is a Game Loss. This upgrade still applies if a player calls a judge with an effect on the stack or resolving that might cause the card to become visible</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> This upgrade path, again, is to discourage cheating. Calling attention to the error only when it would become apparent to the opponent or the judge is very suspicious and abusable, so the penalty is a Game Loss to ensure the practice is heavily disincentivized. Of course, investigation needs to occur in these cases to ensure there isn’t actually cheating, but the route for abuse here still warrants a Game loss penalty<em>.</em></div>
<h5 style="width: 140px;text-align: center"><div class="card"><div class="card-header">Upgrade</div></div></h5>
<p>If an error resulted in more copies of a main deck card being played than were registered and this was discovered after the game had begun, the penalty is a Game Loss unless all copies of the card are still in the random portion of the library. For example if the decklist has two copies of Shock in the main deck and two in the sideboard, but a search finds two copies of Shock in the library with another already in the graveyard, the penalty is upgraded.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> The upgrade applies here because there is no way to know if an advantage has already been gained. Typically, you aren’t going to realize you have three copies of shock until you have already seen/drawn/cast the previous two. In the extremely rare case that a player has enough copies to realize this error in their opening hand (so, 3 or 4 shocks in that hand in the example given), the penalty is not upgraded as long as they call a judge before taking a game action.</div>
