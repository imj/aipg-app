<P>Warning</P>




<Annotation>
	 <P>This infraction is pretty easy to commit. Any time that a library is touched, it is possible that a card will be dropped, or flipped over; or when drawing two cards may get stuck or picked up together.</P>

<P><P>Generally, when we are talking about Looking at Extra Cards, we are talking about a player seeing the face of some card in his or her own deck. However, you might also see some cards in your opponent’s deck while shuffling it.</P>
</P>

<P><P>Be careful not to confuse this infraction with the Hidden Card Error infraction. In particular, the <PageLink to="2.3">Hidden Card Error</PageLink> infraction covers situations where you are looking at some number of cards on the top of your library and you look at too many of them. So, in this specific case, you are looking at extra cards, but you aren’t Looking At Extra Cards. Does your brain hurt? Mine does.</P>
</P>

<P><P>For clarification, dropping a card while shuffling your own library is not Looking at Extra Cards. Just put the card back and continue to randomize your deck.</P>
</P>

<P><P>Observing the face of a card your opponent dropped or flipped is also not Looking at Extra Cards. There are two reasons for this: 1) If a player could drop a card and get their opponent a Warning, they are going to messy-shuffle their way into a top 8. 2) <ExternalLink to="http://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/mtr3-12/">MTR 3.12</ExternalLink> allows players to reveal hidden information to their opponent that they are entitled to know.</P>
</P>

<P><P>It’s important to note that this infraction only applies to cards in a library. If you accidentally look at cards exiled by a <CardLink card="Bomat+Courier">Bomat Courier</CardLink>, that’s not Looking at Extra Cards- it’s a <PageLink to="2.5">Game Rule Violation.</PageLink></P>
</P>

<P><P>As mentioned in the section above, <PageLink to="2.3">Hidden Card Error</PageLink> claims some of the space Looking at Extra Cards used to have. When you are manipulating a set of cards from the top of the library, and you manipulate too many of them, that’s considered Hidden Card Error now.</P>
</P>

<P><P>For the purpose of Hidden Card Error, once the drawn cards have significantly left the library as part of a draw, they can no longer be considered Looking at Extra Cards.</P>
</P>

<P><P>Looking at Extra Cards covers when you knock over a card, drop a card while shuffling, start to draw a card when you shouldn’t, and milling or dredging too many cards. It does not cover looking at 8 cards from <CardLink card="Dig+Through+Time">Dig Through Time</CardLink>, or a scry 2 when it should have only been a scry 1. Milling and dredging are covered by Looking at Extra Cards because the cards are being placed into a public zone, while Dig Through Time is covered by Hidden Card Error because the cards never enter a public zone.</P>
</P>

<P><P>If you’ve seen the face of a card you aren’t supposed to and you haven’t added it to another group, it’s Looking at Extra Cards. The “moved any significant amount from the deck” is there so the judge doesn’t have to deal with the “did they/didn’t they see the card” question. If it’s a “significant” amount away, it’s Looking at Extra Cards. From <ExternalLink to="http://blogs.magicjudges.org/telliott/2017/01/16/policy-changes-for-aether-revolt/">the explanation</ExternalLink> released with the most recent change to this infraction, it is stated that “the key [to determining the LEC/HCE border] is to look at whether the opponent intended (mistakenly or not) to pick up that many cards, or if they were trying to pick up the correct number and failed to do so thanks to bad dexterity (as opposed to bad counting!)”</P>
</P>

<P><P><PageLink to="1.5">Sets</PageLink> are defined in section 1.5, so head there if you need a refresher. Basically, once the card you are just looking at is added to a set of cards, you aren’t looking at it anymore, and the infraction is no longer Looking at Extra Cards but rather Hidden Card Error.</P>
</P>

<P><P>Sometimes players put cards on the table face down before drawing them, for the purpose of counting the cards or for thinking before putting the cards into the hand. This is not forbidden and judges should not penalize it. In this situation the difference is that the player does it intentionally and takes care about not seeing any cards improperly. This statement also applies to the Hidden Card Error infraction.</P>
</P>
</Annotation>

<P>This penalty is applied only once if one or more cards are seen in the same action or sequence of actions.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>We don’t penalize a player for each card seen if all the cards are seen during the same game action or sequence of game actions.</P>

<H1>Examples</H1>

<ListItem><Strong>A.</Strong> A player accidentally reveals (drops, flips over) a card while shuffling her opponent’s library.</ListItem>
<ListItem><Strong>B.</Strong> A player pulls up an extra card while drawing from his library.</ListItem>
<ListItem><Strong>C.</Strong> A player sees the bottom card of her deck when presenting it to her opponent for cutting/shuffling.</ListItem>

<Annotation>
	 <P>In Example B, please consider ‘pulls’ up, as ‘lifts up, but not so much that it could reasonable be considered separate from the library’. </P>

<P><P>Other examples could be: A player flips over an extra card while resolving a cascade ability. A player flips over extra cards when milling his or her deck, and this is noticed immediately.</P>
</P>
</Annotation>

<H1>Philosophy</H1>
<P>A player can accidentally look at extra cards easily and this infraction handles situations where a dexterity or rules error has led to a player seeing cards in a library they shouldn’t have.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>Players touch their decks a lot. They touch to shuffle, they touch to draw, they touch to search. And every time a deck is touched, there is the possibility that you are going to see something you shouldn’t. Since it is easy to do, easy to notice, and easy to fix, a Warning is the appropriate penalty.</P>
</Annotation>

<P>Cards are considered to be in a library until they touch cards in another hidden set. Once those cards have joined another hidden set, the infraction is handled as a Hidden Card Error or Game Rule Violation.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>We all know that drawing is different from looking but sometimes the line is not easy to see. The line here is when the card we are looking at is added to another set of cards, either the hand, or seven other cards from dig through time. Keep in mind that for this infraction, we do allow you to use your judgement a bit when it comes to “I meant to pick up one card and instead I picked up two.” That’s not “adding to a set” just yet.</P>
</Annotation>

<P>Players should not use this penalty to get a “free shuffle” or to attempt to shuffle away cards they don’t want to draw; doing so may be <PageLink to="4.8">Unsporting Conduct — Cheating</PageLink>.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>This point involves judge ability to understand if a player is lying. Some players know that the additional fix for Looking at Extra Cards is a shuffle, so they might “accidentally” peek at a card in order to try to get a shuffle. This is Cheating, and helps to emphasize the point that we need to determine if there are any known cards before we apply the additional fix. When you arrive at the table ask both players some questions to get a sense of what is really happening.</P>
</Annotation>

<P>Players also are not allowed to use this penalty as a stalling mechanism.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>Shuffling a deck requires some time, and players know this. As judges we must prevent players taking advantage of the time limit and understand when a player is trying to do that. This is also considered Cheating, but will be very hard to discover. If it is close to the end of the round, stick around and watch if you suspect this may be the case.</P>
</Annotation>

<P>The library is already randomized, so shuffling in the revealed cards should not involve excessive effort.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>This means that the player doesn’t have to waste time by shuffling as he or she would for the pregame procedure. A few mash shuffles or 3-5 riffle shuffles should be sufficient. The purpose is to “lose” the seen cards in the deck.</P>
</Annotation>

<H1>Additional Remedy</H1>
<P>Shuffle any previously unknown cards into the random portion of the deck, then put any known cards back in their correct locations.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>See <PageLink to="1.3">IPG 1.3</PageLink> on the details on how to randomize a deck. But a summary is: figure out what cards are legally know from things like scry or cascade, and, leaving those cards where they are supposed to be, shuffle any cards left over. If the cards accidentally seen were previously known (like from <CardLink card="Brainstorm">Brainstorm</CardLink>) you don’t have to do this.</P>
