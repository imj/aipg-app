<P>Some infractions in this document refer to “sets” of cards.</P>

<P>A Set is a physically distinct group of cards defined by a game rule or effect. It may correspond to a specific zone, or may represent part of a zone. A Set may consist of a single card.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>This pretty much explains itself. A card may create sets briefly during their resolution (such as Fact or Fiction or Collected Company). If you are holding one or more cards, that’s a set.  If you flipped over the top 3 cards of your library to reveal them, that’s a set.  Other sets simply exist naturally in the game, such as your Library, Graveyard, Exile, and Hand. Just to be as clear as possible, it is also directly spelled out that a single card may be a set.</P>

<P>Cards are considered to be part of a set until they join another set. There is no in-between state and any card that has not yet been seen is part of the previous set (unless the new set is hidden).</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>This is just explicitly clear language to ensure that, no matter how hard you try, there will not exist a card without it being part of a set. Consider any unseen card as a part of the previuous non-hidden set.</P>
