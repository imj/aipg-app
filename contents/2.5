// Game Play Error — Game Rule Violation


<H1>Definition</H1>
<P>This infraction covers the majority of game situations in which a player makes an error or fails to follow a game procedure correctly. It handles violations of the <ExternalLink to="http://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/cr/">Comprehensive Rules</ExternalLink> that are not covered by the other Game Play Errors.</P>

<P>Warning</P>




<Annotation>
	 <P>“Game Rule Violation” does not refer to any particular type of error. Rather, Game Rule Violations are specifically defined as errors that aren’t another infraction. Newer judges will sometimes talk about how “mis-resolving a spell” is a Game Rule Violation. In actuality, resolving a spell improperly could result in one of several different infractions, such as <PageLink to="2.2">Looking at Extra Cards</PageLink> (e.g. forgetting that <CardLink card="Courser+of+Kruphix">Courser of Kruphix</CardLink> left the battlefield) to Hidden Card Error (e.g. mis-reading <CardLink card="Divination">Divination</CardLink> and drawing three cards).

<H1>Examples</H1>

<ListItem><Strong>A.</Strong> A player casts <CardLink card="Wrath+of+God">Wrath of God</CardLink> for 3W (actual cost 2WW).</ListItem>
<ListItem><Strong>B.</Strong> A player does not attack with a creature that must attack each turn.</ListItem>
<ListItem><Strong>C.</Strong> A player fails to put a creature with lethal damage into a graveyard and it is not noticed until several turns later.</ListItem>
<ListItem><Strong>D.</Strong> A <CardLink card="Phyrexian+Revoker">Phyrexian Revoker</CardLink> is on the battlefield that should have had a card named for it.</ListItem>
<ListItem><Strong>E.</Strong> A player casts <CardLink card="Brainstorm">Brainstorm</CardLink> and forgets to put two cards back on top of his library.</ListItem>

<H1>Philosophy</H1>
<P>While Game Rule Violations can be attributed to one player, they usually occur publicly and both players are expected to be mindful of what is happening in the game. It is tempting to try and “fix” these errors, but it is important that they be handled consistently, regardless of their impact on the game.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>Consistency is a core tenet of the IPG. Even though there are thousands of judges adjudicating tournaments across the world, it is important for each of these tournaments to be run and judged to the same standard. For this reason, we strive to handle penalties neutrally. Fundamentally, both players are responsible for maintaining a proper game state. Our core role as judges is not to “correct” or “fix” the players’ mistakes, but to dispassionately interpret and apply the fixes prescribed by the IPG.</P>

<H1>Additional Remedy</H1>
<P>First consider a simple back up (see section 1.4)</P>

<P>If a simple backup is not sufficient and the infraction falls into one of the following categories, and only into that category, perform the fix specified unless a simple backup is possible:</P>

<Annotation>
	 So right here we are going to have a list of partial fixes. Try to do a simple backup (<P> See <PageLink to="1.4">1.4 Backing Up</PageLink> for more information about back ups) </P>
then, if you can’t, you can try to do a partial fix. If you cannot apply a simple backup or a partial fix  you evaluate if you need to do a back up or leave alone.  A recent change here is that you can’t mix partial fixes.  If the error fits more than one of these categories, you’ll need to move ahead to the next part of the fix.  If there are multiple fixes within the same bullet point, you’re still fine to use that partial fix.<P>

<ListItem>If a player made an illegal choice (including no choice where required) for a static ability generating a continuous effect still on the battlefield, that player makes a legal choice.
<Annotation>
	 <P>This partial fix refers to cards such as <CardLink card="True-Name+Nemesis">True-Name Nemesis</CardLink>, <CardLink card="Voice+of+All">Voice of All</CardLink> or a <CardLink card="Outpost+Siege">Siege</CardLink> from Fate Reforged™, which require the choice of a player or color as they enter the battlefield. The reasoning for this is similar to why we apply state-based actions — it is impossible for these cards to exist on the battlefield without a choice being made for them, so we correct that immediately. While this could lead to the perception of advantage for one player, such errors always occur publicly, so it is in both player’s interest to be attentive.</P>
<P>So, if Nick casts <CardLink card="Doom+Blade">Doom Blade</CardLink> on Albert’s <CardLink card="Voice+of+All">Voice of All</CardLink>, we can have Albert chose a color now. If Albert chooses Black, Doom Blade is now illegal. Then, we can do a simple backup to just before Doom Blade was cast.

<ListItem>If a player forgot to draw cards, discard cards, or return cards from their hand to another zone, that player does so.
<Annotation>
	 <P>Players will generally be able to determine with high accuracy if they forgot to draw or discard cards. Note that this partial fix does not expire, even if the error was many turns ago.</P>

</ListItem>
<ListItem>If an object is in an incorrect zone either due to a required zone change being missed or due to being put into the wrong zone during a zone change, the identity of the object was known to all players, and it can be moved with only minor disruption to the current state of the game, put the object in the correct zone.
<Annotation>
	 <P>There is a lot going on in this sentence, so let’s deconstruct it.</P>
<P>– “Object in the incorrect zone due to a required zone change being missed”: This is for where a creature was supposed to die and didn’t, or a card was supposed to be milled and didn’t, Or a creature that is supposed to be bounced and isn’t.</P>
<P>– “or due to being put into the wrong zone during a zone change”: Most commonly this is when a card is supposed to be put in the graveyard, but is put in exile, or vice versa. It technically, doesn’t apply to mill because of the next sentence.</P>
<P>– “the identity of the object was known to all players”: Generally this means going from a public zone to some other zone, but can include cards revealed from the top of the library, or cards revealed for a duress. All players have to know what the card was. Not just where it was, but what it was.</P>
<P>– “and it can be moved with only minor disruption to the current game state”: Things disappearing from the battlefield mid-combat tends to be disruptive. Be sure to look at what decisions and actions are currently being made based on that card being on the battlefield. </P>
<P>Additionally, this partial fix does not include fixing things that shouldn’t have moved but did. For example, a 4/4 with 3 damage is put into the graveyard, and later discovered that it shouldn’t have been. This partial fix does not include returning it to the battlefield.</P>

<ListItem>If damage assignment order has not been declared, the appropriate player chooses that order.
<Annotation>
	 <P>This is seldom relevant. Most times, when there are multiple blockers, it’s clear what the intent is, and there is no real interaction. However, it can become relevant, and we now have this partial fix. Ned may get upset that Abe gets to declare blocking order in the middle of resolving spells; when it suddenly becomes relevant, however, most of the time it becomes relevant as a result of Ned casting a spell. If Ned is doing something that makes blocking order relevant, he cannot assume that whatever blocking order favors him the most is the correct one. He has the responsibility to clarify the ambiguity prior to it becoming relevant.</P>

<P>For each of these fixes, a simple backup may be performed beforehand if it makes applying the fix smoother. Triggered abilities are generated from these partial fixes only if they would have occurred had the action been taken at the correct time.</P>

<Annotation>
	 A simple backup is backing up the last action completed (or one currently in progress) and is sometimes used to make another portion of the prescribed remedy smoother. A simple backup should not involve any random elements. Also while applying a partial fix consider the triggered abilities if they would have occurred while taking the action at the correct time.
</Annotation>

<P>Otherwise, a full backup may be considered or the game state may be left as is.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>So, we look to see if any of the partial fixes apply, and if not, we either rewind or don’t. Please see <PageLink to="1.4">1.4 Backing Up</PageLink> for information on if it’s appropriate to back up.</P>

<P>For most Game Play Errors not caught within a time that a player could reasonably be expected to notice, opponents receive a <PageLink to="2.6">Game Play Error — Failure to Maintain Game State</PageLink> penalty.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>This is simply the definition of <PageLink to="2.6">Game Play Error – Failure to Maintain Game State</PageLink>, and goes back to the concept that keeping the game in a legal and clear state is both players responsibility.</P>
</Annotation>

<P>If the judge believes that both players were responsible for a Game Rule Violation, such as due to the existence of replacement effects or a player taking action based on another player’s instruction, both players receive a <PageLink to="2.5">Game Play Error — Game Rule Violation</PageLink>. For example, if a player casts <CardLink card="Path+to+Exile">Path to Exile</CardLink> on an opponent’s creature and the opponent puts the creature into the graveyard, both players have committed this infraction.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>As always, both players are responsible for maintaining a clear game state. If my card tells you to take an action, and you do it incorrectly, whose fault is it? Yours for doing the action incorrectly, or mine for not making sure my spell resolved correctly? Turns out, in this case, it’s reasonable to say we are both equally at fault. It’s important to realize this is only for active effects. If player A forgets to pay 1 more when casting a shock because he forgot about player N’s <CardLink card="Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben">Thalia, Guardian of Thraben</CardLink>, that is not considered an active effect on player N’s part. In that case, the error is on player A’s shoulders, and player N should get a <PageLink to="2.6">Failure to Maintain Game State</PageLink>.</P>
