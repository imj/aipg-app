// Definition of Penalties

<H1>Warning</H1>
<P>A Warning is an officially tracked penalty.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>A Warning needs to be tracked and judges should write it down on the back of the result slips (if you are using them). Then the <ExternalLink to="http://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/mtr1-9/">Scorekeeper</ExternalLink> will input the warning penalty into WER to let Wizards of the Coast track the infraction. Both the Scorekeeper and the player need to be aware of the penalty. Scorekeepers can notify you when a player is close to an upgrade, and players need to be aware of how many penalties they have.</P>
</Annotation>

<P>Warnings are used in situations of incorrect play when a small amount of time is needed to implement the corrective procedure. The purpose of a Warning is to alert judges and players involved that a problem has occurred and to keep a permanent record of the infraction in the DCI Penalty Database. A time extension should be issued if the ruling has taken more than a minute.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>Warnings are typically issued when judges have to step in to correct a situation. The main purpose of warnings is to give ‘weight’ to the reminder to play more carefully. It’s written down and tracked, therefore it’s significant, but it doesn’t need to be scary.</P>

<P><P>If fixing the game state has taken more than one minute, give a time extension equal to the time taken, unless the match is in extra turns. You did look at the clock before walking up to the table, right?</P>

<H1>Game Loss</H1>
<P>A Game Loss ends the current game immediately and the player who committed the infraction is considered to have lost the game for the purpose of match reporting. The player receiving a Game Loss chooses whether to play or draw in the next game of that match, if applicable. If a Game Loss is issued before the match begins, neither player in that match may use sideboards (if the tournament uses them) for the first game they play.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>If a player gets a Game Loss, that game is over. Board position or “but he was going to lose anyway” doesn’t factor into the decision. The rest of this block tells us what to do for the next game. The player with the Game Loss… lost. So that player gets to decide if he or she plays or draws in the next game in the match. However, if the Game Loss is issued before the first game, the players haven’t actually played a game yet, so they don’t get a chance to sideboard.</P>
</Annotation>

<P>Game Losses are applied to the game in which the offense occurred unless the players have begun a new game or the tournament is between rounds, in which case the loss is applied to the player’s next game.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>Game Losses typically apply to the games the infraction takes place in. However, some errors, most notably <PageLink to="3.5">Deck/Decklist Problems</PageLink> for an improper list, can be assessed between rounds, and have the penalty apply to the next game.</P>
</Annotation>

<P>If simultaneous Game Loss penalties are issued to each player, they are recorded, but do not affect the match score.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>This covers situations where both players have an illegal deck, or other similar circumstances. If we assess both players the Game Loss penalty, only one game in the match will determine the winner. When this occurs it’s rather awkward to assess these penalties as only one player is effectively penalized while the other is not, for the same behavior. To remedy this, you record both penalties, end the current game (if it is still being played) and both players continue to the next game. For the purpose of reporting the score, that specific game didn’t happen.</P>

<H1>Match Loss</H1>
<P>A Match Loss is a severe penalty that is usually issued when the match itself has been compromised.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>There are three infractions that result in a Match Loss penalty.  Upgrading Tardiness; Outside Assistance and Unsporting Conduct – Major.</P>

<P><P>Note that it is possible for a match to become compromised but still continue such as if a spectator commits <PageLink to="3.2">Outside Assistance</PageLink>.</P>
</P>
</Annotation>

<P>Match Losses are applied to the match during which the offense occurred unless the match has already ended, in which case the penalty will be applied to the player’s next match.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P> If the match has already ended, apply the penalty to the next match. </P>
</Annotation>

<H1>Disqualification</H1>
<P>A Disqualification is issued for activity that damages the integrity of a tournament as a whole or for severe unsporting conduct.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>Disqualifications are for the most severe infractions. Don’t feel bad about these. Remember, you don’t give penalties. Players earn them.</P>
</Annotation>

<P>The recipient of a Disqualification does not need to be a player in the tournament. He or she may be a spectator or other bystander. If this happens, he or she must be entered into the tournament in Wizards Event Reporter (“WER”) so that he or she may be disqualified and reported to the DCI.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>The reason for doing so is that DCI need to gather all the Disqualification reports for when they update the <ExternalLink to="http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/suspended-dci-memberships">suspended players list</ExternalLink>. If a spectator has done something really bad, the DCI still has the right to ban him or her from taking part in sanctioned events. Get the person’s name or DCI number, even if you have to ask around. Remember to collect statements and enter an investigation report.</P>
</Annotation>

<P>Disqualification can occur without proof of action so long as the Head Judge determines sufficient information exists to believe the tournament’s integrity may have been compromised. It is recommended that the Head Judge’s report reflect this fact.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P><Strong>Magic</Strong> events are not a court of law, nor an episode of CSI:Miami. You do not need a smoking gun or DNA evidence. The Head Judge does not need to prove that his or her decision is right, he or she just needs sufficient information to justify it. However, if you disqualify without evidence, you need to record that as well. And the investigation committee still has the right to ask the Head Judge to explain why he or she thought the player should be disqualified.</P>
</Annotation>

<P>When this penalty is applied, the player loses his or her current match and is dropped from the tournament. If a player has already received prizes at the time he or she is disqualified, that player may keep those prizes but does not receive any additional prizes or awards he or she may be due.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>When a player is disqualified from the tournament, his or her event is over. The results of the matches or games he or she has finished won’t be changed, and if the player has already received prizes prior to the Disqualification, he or she gets to keep what has already been received. However, he or she is not given anything he or she is yet to receive. This is mainly to avoid the legal complications of “taking back” something that has already been given.</P>

<P><P>All Disqualifications should be reported to the <ExternalLink to="http://blogs.magicjudges.org/o/spheres/investigations-committee/">Investigations Committee</ExternalLink> by using the <ExternalLink to="http://judge.wizards.com">Judge Center</ExternalLink>. The player’s statement and the Head Judge’s brief report are needed. The testimonies of spectators are optional. Here is a pretty good article on <ExternalLink to="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=judge/article/20091207a">the ‘paperwork’ aspect of a Disqualification</ExternalLink>.</P>

<P>When a player is disqualified during a tournament, he or she is removed from the tournament and does not take up a place in the standings. This means that all players in the tournament will advance one spot in the standings and are entitled to any prizes the new standing would offer. If the Disqualification takes place after a cut is made, no additional players advance in place of the disqualified player although they do move up a spot in the standings. For example, if a player is disqualified during the quarterfinal round of a Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier, the former 9th place finisher does not advance into the single elimination top 8, but he or she does move into 8th place in the standings.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>This paragraph is to tell judges (and players) what happens when a player is disqualified. A very common question is “Well, now that a spot in the Top 8 is available, can 9th place get it?” The answer is: if it’s after the cut, no you can’t.</P>
