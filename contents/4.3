// Unsporting Conduct — Improperly Determining a Winner


<H1>Definition</H1>
<P>A player uses or offers to use a method that is not part of the current game (including actions not legal in the current game) to determine the outcome of a game or match.</P>



 
<P><Strong>Penalty</Strong></P>

<P>Disqualification</P>



<Annotation>
	 <P>As judges, we want players actually playing Magic at our tournaments. This is not only because the point of a Magic tournament is to actually play Magic, but also to uphold Magic’s reputation and position as a game of skill, not chance. This is important for ensuring that Magic isn’t associated with gambling. In addition, game actions that could not be taken legally to come to an agreement about the outcome of the game are not permitted – see example F below.</P>

<P><P>As a result, even just offering to use an outside-the-game-method (or an illegal action within the game) falls into this infraction. Moreover, unlike <PageLink to="4.8">Cheating</PageLink>, a player can receive this infraction even if they did not know they were doing anything wrong. Again, this high standard is necessary to ensure that Magic’s global reputation doesn’t become tarnished. (The <ExternalLink to="http://blogs.magicjudges.org/o/spheres/investigations-committee/">Investigations Committee</ExternalLink> that handles suspensions will often be understanding of players who unknowingly violate this section — but that is not the job for the judge who actually responds to the issue at an event!)</P>

<P>A player who receives an offer and does not immediately contact a tournament official is considered complicit in the offer and will receive the same penalty.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>Players are also expected to immediately call a judge if their opponent offers to determine the outcome of a game or match. Failing to do so will result in both players receiving the same penalty.
</P>
<P><P>What are actions that are “not part of the current game”? The IPG provides some helpful examples:</P>

<H1>Examples</H1>

<ListItem><Strong>A.</Strong> As time is called, two players about to draw roll a die to determine the winner.</ListItem>
<ListItem><Strong>B.</Strong> A player offers to flip a coin to determine the winner of a match.</ListItem>
<ListItem><Strong>C.</Strong> Two players arm wrestle to determine the winner of the match.</ListItem>
<ListItem><Strong>D.</Strong> Two players play rock-paper-scissors to decide if they should play the match or draw.</ListItem>
<ListItem><Strong>E.</Strong> Two players compare the converted mana costs of the top cards of their libraries to determine the winner of a game at the end of extra turns.</ListItem>
<ListItem><Strong>F.</Strong> Two players reveal cards from the top of their libraries to see “who would win” after extra turns.</ListItem>

<Annotation>
	 <P>While using a random method like a die roll or coin toss is the most common example of an outside-the-game method, employing any method that isn’t the requisite game of Magic fits into this category. It doesn’t matter if the method is completely random (like a coin or die), has a physical component (arm wrestling), or is even another game entirely (like Tic-Tac-Toe or Yu-Gi-Oh). Another more controversial decision is for players to use “future cards” to determine who would win. At the end of a match, it is fine for players to use current board position to make a case of who should concede to whom; however, they must make a decision based on what they see. Players may reveal cards that they are legally entitled to see, such as their hands. They may not reveal cards that they are not entitled to see within the game, such as cards in libraries. It is not allowed to make an offer like “If I drew another land I would win. If my next card is a land, you scoop to me, else, I’ll scoop to you.”</P>

<H1>Philosophy</H1>
<P>Using an outside-the-game method to determine a winner compromises the integrity of the tournament.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>As stated earlier, the results of Magic tournaments should be reached only through playing actual games of Magic. Doing otherwise compromises the integrity of the tournament. What does “compromise the integrity of the tournament” mean? It means we have games of Magic that are being determined by some method other than the Magic games the players are supposed to play, and that impacts the results of that match and the tournament as a whole. It affects other matches and other players’ standings in the event. Rolling a dice to determine the winner is playing the system, not playing the game.</P>

<P><P>So why a Disqualification? There are a few reasons. One is that Wizards of the Coast wants to impose a hard line on anything that makes Magic resemble gambling. Some countries/venues have very strict laws about gambling, and might not allow a Magic event. But why a Disqualification? Why not a Match Loss or a Warning? Let’s look at a player’s motivation. Two players are tied at the end of the round and are playing in a match where a draw knocks both of them out of Top 8 (or Day 2). If one of them wins, he or she is in. In that case, if they draw or lose, their day is done. So only the most severe penalties will discourage the last ditch effort to make Top 8.</P>

<P>Matches that result in a draw due to time are expected to be reported as such and are not excluded from this penalty if the players use an illegal method to determine the outcome.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>Draws are a valid result for a Magic game. Trying to avoid a draw doesn’t give players an excuse to use an outside-the-game method to determine a winner.</P>

<P><P>That said, if a player asks his or her opponent to concede because he or she has an overwhelming board position when time is called, that is not <PageLink to="4.3">Improperly Determining a Winner</PageLink>, because nothing outside the game has actually been introduced into the scenario. Of course, the opponent has every right to refuse, and in that case the match result will simply be determined normally.</P>
