// Game Play Error — Mulligan Procedure Error


		<div style="">
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">A player makes an error as part of the mulligan process. This infraction does not apply to errors made once pre-game procedures are complete.</p>
</div>

<p style="text-align: center;margin-top: 10px;margin-left: -10px"><strong>Penalty</strong></p>

<p style="margin-top: -5px"></p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <em>While this infraction is called Mulligan Procedure Error, it can apply before any mulligans have been taken. Most of the errors are listed in the examples. Once all the pre-game procedures are complete, any other error is going to be a different infraction, drawing a card when on the play is a Hidden Card Error for example.</em><br>
</div><p></p>
<p>“Scrying” for more than one card after taking a mulligan is treated as a Hidden Card Error.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0px"><span style="font-weight: 400"></span></p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400">While the mulligan scry is technically during the mulligan process, the Mulligan Procedure Error doesn’t really fit, and the HCE penalty and fix is a much better fit philosophically, so we handle it there.  Additionally, if they just pick up the second card, and haven’t scry’ed yet, Looking at Extra Cards is appropriate.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"></span></div><p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0px">Trivial process errors that provide no advantage, such as declaring an intent to mulligan early, are not an infraction.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <em>Try not to overthink this infraction. If a player does something wrong that isn’t listed in the examples, compare the impact of that error and decide if it’s trivial or not.</em><p></p>
<p><em><strong>Examples:</strong></em></p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 5px">
<li>A player on the draw declares that they will keep before the player on the play</li>
<li>One player puts a Leyline onto the battlefield before their opponent finishes their mulligans</li>
</ul>
<p>Technically these are procedural errors, but at this time in the match the impact is very low and should not be treated as an infraction.<br>
</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">Examples</h2>
<ul class="list-group" style="text-align: justify;margin-left: 0px">
<li class="list-group-item"><strong>A.</strong> A player draws eight cards at the start of the game (instead of seven).</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><strong>B.</strong> A player draws seven cards at the start of the game (instead of six) after taking a mulligan.</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><strong>C.</strong> A player keeps their hand, scries, then mulligans again.</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><strong>D.</strong> A player chooses to not take a mulligan then takes a mulligan after seeing his opponent choose to take a mulligan.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;margin-top: 20px">Philosophy</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0px">Errors prior to the beginning of the game have a less disruptive option—a forced mulligan—that is not available at any other point during the game. However, players should not be incentivized to sit on the infraction until mulligan procedures are completed so that they can ‘discover’ the error at a point where it becomes a <a href="http://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/ipg2-3/">Hidden Card Error</a> if they believe that is to their advantage. To encourage the offending player to report their error as early as possible, they are given their choice of remedy before the game begins.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <em>It can be quite easy to make an error in the pre-game procedure, drawing too many cards the most common one, so we give the player the option of either revealing their hand (as with Hidden Card Error) or choosing to mulligan. As they will not be able to choose to mulligan if this is discovered after the start of the game there should be less chance a player will wait until then to discover this error.</em><br>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0px">If a player looks at the top card of their library after taking a mulligan, it is assumed that they have chosen to keep their hand unless they make it very clear that they intend to mulligan again, either verbally before looking or by picking up multiple cards from the top of their library.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <em>Players who mulligan have the opportunity to effectively Scry 1 after all players have kept their opening hand. It can be very hard for the opponent or a judge to know whether looking at the top card of the library is the player taking that scry or seeing what the next card is going to be before taking another mulligan. If they haven’t said anything, then the default assumption is that they are keeping their hand and are performing the scry action. If they pick up and look at more than one card it should be obvious that they are not keeping their hand.</em><br>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">Additional Remedy</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">If the player has too many cards in hand, they may choose to reveal his or her hand, and his or her opponent chooses a card from it to be shuffled back into the library. If more than one excess card was drawn (for example, eight cards drawn during a mulligan to 6) their opponent continues removing cards until the correct number has been reached.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0px">If cards are not removed from the hand this way (either due to an error that didn’t lead to too many cards, or by the player choosing not to reveal), that player takes an additional mulligan.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <em>If the error were examples C or D, the player does have the correct number of cards in hand, so the only option for the player is to mulligan again. The other examples will result in too many cards, so the player can choose which of the remedies to take. The two options are pretty straightforward: reveal their hand and have the opponent choose the excess cards to shuffle back, or take another mulligan.</em><p></p>
<p><em>Make sure the player knows how many cards to mulligan to. If they mulliganed to 6 but drew 7, they should now be mulliganing to 5. If they mulliganed to 6, scried, then mulliganed to 5, they should now be mulliganing to 4.</em><br>
</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0px">Players may continue taking mulligans after the remedy has been completed.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <em>Whichever remedy is performed, if the player still doesn’t like their hand they can continue the mulliganing process.</em><br>
