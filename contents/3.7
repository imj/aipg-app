// Tournament Error — Communication Policy Violation


<H1>Definition</H1>
<P>A player violates the Player Communication policy detailed in <ExternalLink to="http://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/mtr4-1/">section 4.1</ExternalLink> of the <Strong>Magic</Strong> Tournament Rules. This infraction only applies to violations of that policy and not to general communication confusion.</P>

	 <P>If there was an award for the most incorrectly given infraction, Communication Policy Violation would have a shelf in its living room cluttered with them. It is a common misconception that any time there is a miscommunication between players it’s a Communication Policy Violation. It was so commonly misunderstood that in Feb 2013 the infraction was renamed from “Player Communication Violation” to “Communication Policy Violation” to help drive home the point that we are talking a specific policy violation and not general problems with player communication. This infraction covers violations of the Communication Policy in the <Strong>Magic</Strong> Tournament Rules (<ExternalLink to="http://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/mtr4-1/">section 4.1</ExternalLink>) which is summarized in the philosophy section below.
Note that a new addition to the Magic Tournament Rules section 4.2 relating to not assuming your opponent has taken a shortcut also falls under this infraction.  Expect this definition to be updated in the next version.

<H1>Examples</H1>

<ListItem><Strong>A.</Strong> A player is asked how many cards he has in his hand and answers “Three.” A few moments later, he realizes that he has four.</ListItem>
<ListItem><Strong>B.</Strong> A player claims she hasn’t played her land for the turn, but it is determined that she had and forgot.</ListItem>

<Annotation>
	 <P>In the first example, we have a situation where a player was incorrect about derived information. In the second example, we have the player being incorrect about free information. These two types of examples are the most common. Note that neither of these examples involves a situation where one player thought he heard his opponent say something else, or confusion about what step or phase they are in.</P>

<H1>Philosophy</H1>
<P>Clear communication is essential when playing <Strong>Magic</Strong>. Though many offenses will be intentional, it is possible for a player to make a genuine mistake and these should not be penalized harshly.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>We all agree that playing magic face to face is quite different from playing Magic Online on a computer. Clear communication should help players express their thoughts and ensure that the game can be played. We want players to talk to each other. We want them to communicate. But players are human, and they will make mistakes. For those wrong answers which you believe are unintentional, the player should be given a Warning. We don’t want a more severe penalty, because we don’t want players scared to communicate with each other for fear of getting a penalty.</P>

<P>Refer to <ExternalLink to="http://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/mtr4-1/">section 4.1</ExternalLink> of the <Strong>Magic</Strong> Tournament Rules for a full explanation of the policy. It can be summarized as:</P>


<ListItem>Players must answer all questions asked of them by a judge completely and honestly, regardless of the type of information requested. Players may request to do so away from the match.</ListItem>
<ListItem>Players may not represent derived or free information incorrectly.</ListItem>
<ListItem>Players must answer completely and honestly any specific questions pertaining to free information.</ListItem>

<Annotation>
	 <P>The policy is a bit more complicated than the summary above, so I urge you to read it. In short, the Communication Policy in the MTR governs what information players must provide their opponents with. A player can withhold some information from his or her opponent, but not from a judge. Judges expect (and can require) players to answer their questions. If you answer a question/or make a statement about free or derived information, it must be correct. If a player is asked about free information, he or she must answer completely and truthfully. If asked about derived information, the player is only required to be truthful to the opponent, but does not have to answer completely.</P>

<H1>Additional Remedy</H1>
<P>A backup may be considered in cases where a player has clearly acted upon incorrect information provided to him or her by his or her opponent. The backup should be to the point of the action, not the erroneous communication.</P>

<Annotation>
	 <P>Sometimes a Communication Policy Violation doesn’t matter. Sometimes it does. Typically you, as judge, will only get calls “when it matters,” and will need to consider a rewind. If I ask you what the power/toughness of your creature is, and you say “2/3,” I can feel safe attacking with my 3/3. But if we discover during declare blockers that it’s a 3/4, well, I would have done things differently had you answered correctly. I based my decision on information you provided me, since I should be able to expect honest answers about certain things. This wasn’t a case where I made a play mistake or a strategic error. In the the case where it is clear that a player took actions based on the incorrect data, then a rewind, as outlined in <PageLink to="1.4">IPG 1.4 Backing Up</PageLink>, can be considered.</P>
